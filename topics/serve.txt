The "skyux serve" command serves the current SKY UX single-page application locally and opens the host endpoint with the necessary query string to pull your local files. It tacks on "local=true" in the query string to instruct SKY UX Host to pull files from the local machine instead of the hosted location. The serve command also sets a cookie to apply local dev mode. Keep in mind that since skyux serve serves your SPA over HTTPS, any additional requests from your code such as AJAX requests must also be over HTTPS.
