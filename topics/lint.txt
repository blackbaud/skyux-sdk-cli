The "skyux lint" command runs the TSLint extension against the files in the src folder. The extension validates TypeScript code against the rules specified in the tslint.json file in the SKY UX repo. Other commands such as "skyux build" and "skyux e2e" also run TSLint, but "skyux lint" allows you to run TSLint in isolation from those commands.
