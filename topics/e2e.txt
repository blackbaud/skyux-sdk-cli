The "skyux e2e" command runs end-to-end tests that test your SPA running in a real browser, interacting with it as users would. The "e2e" command uses a tool called Protractor to look for files in the e2e folder with names that end in .e2e-spec.ts. End-to-end tests supplement the Karma unit test, but end-to-end files are written slightly differently. Both test files use a syntax called Jasmine.
